fp_twp2x,WEAPON,"A specialised point defense weapon firing thermal explosive charges to deal with heavy fighters. It fires at missiles as well like standard PD but doesn't have same raw damage output as those specialized against missiles unless multiple are used at once.
It can also damage ship armour though the proximity detonation causes it to not always deal full damage.",,,,
fp_tracker,WEAPON,Fires modified arbalest shells that allow old non auto-locking missiles to track the target once enough have hit. The kinetic and explosive combo makes it a versatile weapon.,,,,
#fp_wyvernfire,WEAPON,A pair of dragonfire emitters attached to a weapon mount with modified power output to not blow up resulting in a potent laser dual laser cannon.,,,,
fp_wyvernfire,WEAPON,Fires a near instant burst laser at long range useful for picking off far away targets. The highly focused nature of it makes it potent against armour but recharge times are lengthy making it unsuitable for prolonged fire fights. The dual barrel design makes targeting more difficult reducing the range compared to its smaller counterpart but large mount integration increases rate of fire and flux efficiency.,,,,
fp_wyvernfire_medium,WEAPON,Fires a near instant burst laser at long range useful for picking off far away targets. The highly focused nature of it makes it potent against armour but recharge times are lengthy making it unsuitable for prolonged fire fights.,,,,

fp_dictator_torpedo,WEAPON,6 Torpedo tubes built into the prow firing in a spread pattern to maximize the chances of hitting when fired into enemy fleets and can be devastating against single enemies at close range. Due to being built into the prow the weapon is disabled should the prow ever break.,,,,
fp_dictator_novacannon,WEAPON,This fearsome weapon projects plasma explosions over vast distances ignoring any obstacles. The lengthy firing sequence requires the ship to remain stationary making it difficult to use against smaller vessels and runs the risk of being outflanked but the range and power more than makes up for it against larger foes. The energy signature of the weapon does reveals where the explosion will occur giving targets a small respite.,,,,
fp_macromortar,WEAPON,Based on the ubiquitous mortar weapons found all over the sector the Macro Mortar fires not only larger but also more advanced shells with a higher yield and a better flight trajectory. The weapon may have a lower overall damage output compared to its cheaper counterpart but in actual combat the improvements should outweigh the downsides.,,,,
fp_plasmarail,WEAPON,In an attempt at firing cheap munition at a higher velocity they melted while firing. Fortunately a lump of hot plasma is still dangerous to most vessels.,,,,

all skill volition subsumed 
into issues",,,,
fp_mudskipper_mk3,SHIP,"Despite being constructed from a salvaged mudskipper, a TPC firing assembly and an antiquated heatsink this design still resembles the first TPC prototyping platforms. In current cycles it is popular among Pirates and Hedgemony history enthusiasts.",,,,
fp_hemlock,SHIP,The Hemlock is built using a smaller branch of 'high tech' ship manifacturing relying even more on movement and avoiding hits rather than hiding behind a solid shield. Built for speed and carrying a fearsome prototype weapon it is a force to be reckoned with given that the pilot is skilled and that the engines remain intact.,,,,
fp_dauntless,SHIP,The Dauntless is an antiquated ship design brought back to life by the leagues shipyards to see whether or not modern parts can make it a capable ship.,,,,
fp_bell,SHIP,"The Budgerigar was designed as a compact carrier with stronger armor than typical midline ships to compete with the heron which ultimately outclassed it as a carrier. It was then redesigned, removing parts of the fighter compartments to house a main weapon similar to the sunder to differentiate it. It now stands on its own as a compact cruiser sized battle-carrier although it is still seen as out of place in standard midline fleets due to a lack of mobility.",,,,
fp_pcondor,SHIP,A ship repurposed to get back in by those whose minds were altered from one too many phase dives.,,,,
fp_phammerhead,SHIP,A ship repurposed to get back in by those whose minds were altered from one too many phase dives.,,,,
fp_ewship,SHIP,A technologically advanced destroyer affectionately known as the 'cup' is a proof of concept that the advanced sensor technology of the Apogee can be used for active electronic warfare. Should this ship become adopted by captains around the sector more designs are sure to appear as Tri-Tachyon never misses an opportunity for credits.,,,,
fp_hammerslaught,SHIP,A design created by a fraudster pretending to be a ship designer. When Hedgemony officials caught him he gave them this hastily put together blueprin before being spaced for fraud. The practicality of this ship is questionable but it does fit a lot of guns.,,,,
fp_prime,SHIP,The Prime is built from an incomplete blueprint of a premium cruiser design. Fortunately the engineers who improvised the missing parts were highly skilled and the ship turned out hardy and fully functional if not exactly as originally intended.,,,,
fp_buster,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.",,,,
fp_phaseminer,SHIP,"One of the earlier types of phase ships, before modern 'safe' Tri-Tachyon phase coils. The Moth is a potent cruiser used for many p-space experiments, such as the development of the automated phase drone that aids it in combat. Its only drawback is its aging phase coil design and sluggish handling.",,,,
fp_tube,SHIP,BuretteII is a fast and fragile destroyer derived from a science vessel. The ship was militarized to attempt to stay relevant.,,,,
fp_tonk,SHIP,A patrol boat that defies the midline doctrine with higher durability but lesser maneuverability than its peers. It functions to keep Persean space safe by dissuading criminals with its built-in cannon or providing fire support in larger skirmishes.,,,,
fp_voidstalker,SHIP,"One of the pinnacles of 'mirage tech', it is faster and more maneuverable than any capital class ship should be capable of along with potent frontal firepower. However it is extremely vulnurable if its engines ever stops working.",,,,
fp_condorcap,SHIP,A large capital ship showing it's age but it still has potent frontal firepower and powerful engines.,,,,
fp_hauler,SHIP,The Venture's bigger brother suited for heavy duty mining operations.,,,,

fp_striker,SHIP,Nimble and equipped with a timeflow altering system the Striker can go toe-to-toe with other cruisers despite the lack of large weapons or hunt down smaller ships with ease.,,,,
fp_hoarder,SHIP,"The Hoarder is on the verge of impracticality with plenty of mounts and respectable fighter capacity, both taking their toll on its flux grid. It acts more similar to a small battlecarrier than a standard cruiser and can be be outfitted to fit both carrier and gunship roles.",,,,
fp_elite,SHIP,"The current pinnacle of Sector-8 design, the Elite is a quick battlecruiser that can use mobility to its pick fights with other capital ships and deliver heavy blows with large energy based firepower.",,,,
fp_severance,SHIP,A Diktat original design improving on the Sunder-class to fit the Diktat's superiour doctrine. In accordance with Andrada's specifications the Severance can output even more firepower than the Sunder which independent Sindrian sources assures is due to the superiour quality engineering and not the Severance cruiser sized hull.,,,,
fp_adjucator,SHIP,A Diktat original design to bring capitalship level firepower to cowardly enemies who would try running from fleets headed by the heavier Executor-class. The Adjucator-class battlecruiser brings all out frontal firepower and Sindrian officials assures that the lack of rear point defense should pose no issue to the Diktat's skilled pilots.,,,,
fp_bigboi,SHIP,"A marvel of engineering, a symbol of Sindrian might, an irradiated deathtrap. The Lion-class symbolises the Supreme Executors ambition sporting every feature he asked for, no questions asked. It has thick bulkheads, advanced energy weapon support and heavy weaponry including the largest weapon the Diktat engineers could manage. Some dissenting voices may ask if the amount of crew being replaced everytime the Lion docks has anything to do with the unshielded energy stabilisers and rumors that 'the Lion eats its crew' started spreading but this has been dismissed as anti Diktat propaganda. Officially no ship can match the Lion-class.",,,,
fp_challenger,SHIP,Built as an alternative to the Legion but fell out of favour due to lacking the same carrier capabilities. It is still a formidable ship with lots of loadout flexibility.,,,,
fp_minimote,SHIP,Using [classified] technology this ship was approved by Tri-Tachyon higher ups worried that their rivals would use phase ships to get the upper hand.,,,,
fp_dictator,SHIP,The Lamenter is an antiquated battleship brought back to life by the Luddic Church in their need to keep up with the arms race in the sector without compromising their teachings. With its highly armoured prow in can close the distance in order to deliver overwhelming broadside firepower.,,,,
fp_dictator_large,SHIP,"The Lamenter is an antiquated battleship brought back to life by the Luddic Church in their need to keep up with the arms race in the sector without compromising their teachings. With its highly armoured prow in can close the distance in order to deliver overwhelming broadside firepower.
The Knight variant fields even more firepower instead of fighter bays.",,,,
fp_dauntless_new,SHIP,Using the same style of combat as its larger counterpart the Preacher uses its armoured prow to close the distance in order to deliver broadside firepower. Whether or not it can compete with contemporary cruisers is up for debate but for those with little choice they will find it a formidable ship.,,,,
